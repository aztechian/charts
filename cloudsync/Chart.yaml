  Helm Chart for periodically synchronizing cloud storage.

  This chart is not related to the CloudSync application from a popular NAS hardware maker. 

  I had a need to mirror my data from on-premise S3 storage into AWS S3 for 
  offsite backup. This chart creates a Kubernetes CronJob that uses the fantasitc
  [RClone](https://rclone.org) tool as the pod image, and creates and mounts an rclone.conf
  configuration onto that Pod. At the moment it is specific for s3 sources and destinations,
  but I'm open to making it support more/general rclone config - please ask for it in a 
  GitHub issue - if this would help you.
