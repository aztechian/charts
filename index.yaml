    description: Helm Chart for periodically synchronizing cloud storage.  This chart
      is not related to the CloudSync application from a popular NAS hardware maker.   I
      had a need to mirror my data from on-premise S3 storage into AWS S3 for  offsite
      backup. This chart creates a Kubernetes CronJob that uses the fantasitc [RClone](https://rclone.org)
      tool as the pod image, and creates and mounts an rclone.conf configuration onto
      that Pod. At the moment it is specific for s3 sources and destinations, but
      I'm open to making it support more/general rclone config - please ask for it
      in a  GitHub issue - if this would help you.

    description: This chart creates a deployment of Transmission, a BitTorrent client.
      Additionally, it creates a VPN connection to tunnel bittorrent traffic through.
      The Transmission UI is still accessible via a Service and/or Ingress in the
      cluster, but all torrent traffic is sent through the VPN interface.

      Note:  > This Chart is a re-hosting of the official YoutubeDL-Material repository
      Since the [YoutubeDL-Material](https://github.com/Tzahi12345/YoutubeDL-Material)
      doesn''t have a way to directly use their helm chart (ie, its not in a helm
      repository), this version is an unmodified copy of that chart but ends up being
      published to https://repos.imartin.io/charts for ease-of-use.'
